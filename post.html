              <h5>RAW vs JPEG</h5>
              <p>The JPEG file format is limited to 8 bits of color, which is significantly less than 16 bits availbe in the RAW format. This means that if your photo is too dark, or the colors are not vibrant enough, there is much less you can do in terms of post processing. 16 bit images are much more editable and the extra data they provide makes the post processing process much more powerful. </p>
              <h5>Photoshop and GIMP</h5>
              <p>Photoshop is the defacto choice for professional photographers and for good reason. Photoshop boasts a rich set of features that makes almost any editing task possible. Editing is made easy with plenty of tutorials on the internet that teach you how to do almost any task. While an amazingly powerful and well documented tool, Photoshop has an expensive price tag that may put it out of the grasp of many potential users. If you can afford it, there is no better product!</p>
              <p>Gimp is a free alternative to Photoshop, and while not quite as powerful, it can handle most simple edits and many advanced ones. There are plenty of tutorials for GIMP, but because it is not the industry standard, in my experience they are lower quality. This makes GIMP an amazing and affordable alternative, but ultimately not your first choice. </p>
              <h5>Lightroom & Darktable</h5>
              <p>Lightroom is much less about available features, because you can do most of the same edits inside Photoshop, and much more about workflow. If you want a more organized way to import photos onto your computer, organize them, and then make small edits, Lightroom is perfect for you. It is best in addition to Photoshop and in my mind is not a standalone product (though this is probably controversial).  </p>
              <p>Darktable is a free alternative to Lightroom. Darkroom is to Lightroom as what GIMP is to Photoshop. It is free and has a large, though not quite as rich, feature set. Personally, I found the product much less intuitive to use. But, the product is still very powerful and can be a great tool for post production on a tight budget. </p>
              <h5>Where to Display your Photos</h5>
              <p>You now have a great camera, you’ve adjusted all your settings, you’ve filled the frame and thought opposite, and you’ve edited the photos. Now where do they go? If you’re a photographer, it is essential that you have an Instagram account to share your photos. The social media network has quickly become a community for photographers to share their work and communicate. More than that, as a professional, it can become your portfolio/resume for a job. It can also be useful for your records and gives you an audience and purpose to edit your photos. I find Instagram to be an engaging way for me create photography oriented goals for myself.  </p>
              <p>Another option is to get your photos printed, and though this can be expensive, it’s a great way to celebrate and display your own artwork. Because printing is a physical process, a printed image can appear quite different from a computer or phone screen. This is really interesting and adds more to consider in terms of color and composition. </p>
